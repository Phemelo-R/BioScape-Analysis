# Honours Project: Leucadendron argenteum Spectral Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains my Honours project exploring the spectral properties and remote sensing of *Leucadendron argenteum*, a rare and iconic plant species of South Africa. The project involves data analysis, spectral profiling, and geospatial mapping using satellite and airborne remote sensing datasets from the BioSCape campaign (2023).

## Data Sources

The datasets used in this project were downloaded from the following sources:

- [Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) Bioscape 2023 Campaign](https://popo.jpl.nasa.gov/avng/y23_bioscape/)
- [Bioscape NetCDF Data Archive](https://popo.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/bioscape_netCDF/)
- [LVIS Facility L2 Geolocated Surface Elevation and Canopy Height Product V001](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=LVIS&qt=2023-10-20T00%3A00%3A00.000Z%2C2023-11-15T23%3A59%3A59.999Z&fi=LVIS-Camera!LVIS&fdc=National%2BSnow%2Band%2BIce%2BData%2BCenter%2BDistributed%2BActive%2BArchive%2BCenter%2B%2528NSIDC%2BDAAC%2529&fpj=BioSCape&_ga=2.63606251.53278573.1721067437-1362124365.1714395655&_gl=1*q0ghrk*_ga*MTM2MjEyNDM2NS4xNzE0Mzk1NjU1*_ga_LQ2P0SNJCZ*MTcyMTU5NTQ4Ni4xMjMuMS4xNzIxNTk1NjkxLjAuMC4w)

## Species Focus

All analyses in this repository focus on **Leucadendron argenteum**.

## Project Structure

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** I will upload Jupyter notebooks that document my workflow, code, and analysis. These notebooks will show my working steps and results.
- **Data:** Data files are referenced from the above sources and should be downloaded separately due to their size.
- **Scripts:** Any Python scripts or modules used to support the analysis will also be included.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the relevant data from the sources above.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks to follow the analysis.

## Citation & Acknowledgements

If you use the data or code, please cite the relevant data providers and acknowledge the AVIRIS-NG Bioscape campaign and NASA JPL. Thank you.
